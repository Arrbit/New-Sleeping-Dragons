# New-Sleeping-Dragons

Is the new Wordpress-Theme for [SleepingDragons.eu](https://sleepingdragons.eu/). This is still a work in progress.
The old code was written a bit less like wordpress likes (a lot of requires, namespaces and a php singleton :D). This is a more back to the roots approach.

Using [Bootstrap 5 as helpers](https://getbootstrap.com/) for mobile and more i guess!

# Recommended Plugins
- [WP Featherlight](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-featherlight/)
- WIP

# Major Changes
Added a proper lightbox thanks to **WP Featherlight**, to display all your screenshots in bigger happiness.
This also changes how the featured Image works. It does not link to the post itself anymore. (what use did that ever have??)
